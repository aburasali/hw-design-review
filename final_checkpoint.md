# Final Checkpoint and Handoff

The goal of this checkpoint is to ensure your project can be handed off to a future team for enhancements and maintenance.

Each project will be "checked off" for this deliverable by the same project team with whom they did the Design Review assignment, which we'll call the "visiting team" again.

The visiting team will:

* Clone the home team's repo, and ensure that bundle install and rake db:setup  run successfully
* Ensure `rails server` starts the app successfully
* Ensure `rake cucumber` and `rake spec` do not give errors
* Ensure the app can be deployed to Heroku (or some other way, as indicated in its `README.md`), including documentation (in the 
`README.md` or the master repo's wiki) of any addons, environment variables (`figaro`), or special 
configuration needed to make this happen
* If any additional steps are necessary to try out the app--seed the database with fake data, use a particular login name/password, 
etc.--ensure these work as documented

**The teams must work together to get each others' apps stood up.**  Each team will only get credit for the final checkpoint if they *both* help the other team get their app in shape *and* get their own app in good enough shape for the other team to stand it up.
