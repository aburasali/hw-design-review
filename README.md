# Team Assignment: Design and Presentation Reviews

For many modern software companies, two essential aspects of the design
process are _design reviews_ and _technical presentations_. 

One way to present work to be reviewed is to give a technical
presentation, for example using PowerPoint slides or other visual aids
to walk the audience through some technical issue that is central to the
review.  Giving an effective technical presentation is important, but
equally important is the audience's ability to absorb that presentation
and provide specific constructive feedback---whether about the
clarity of the presentation itself or the technical content presented.
